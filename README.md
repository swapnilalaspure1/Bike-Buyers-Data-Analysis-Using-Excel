# Bike-Buyers-Data-Analysis-Using-Excel
 In this Mini project, I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and then loaded it into Excel.
 Following this, I performed data cleaning and transformation processes using logical Excel formulas. 
 I removed duplicate records, and subsequently loaded the data into the Power Pivot for data analysis. 
 I created a detailed report on the bike buyer's dataset.
